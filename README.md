- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Bartosz Zych. I was born in Poland but I live in Ireland for the past 16 years! I graduated from IT Carlow studying Computer Games Development.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things. Once a subject intrigues me, I find myself reserching it and trying it out. I like to try new things and most definetly not
      afraid of challanges. So far my favorite hobby is rock climbing indoors but very excited to try it outdoors on natural rocks! Technology in general is one of
      my biggest intrests and how it leads to human evolution.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about programming practices. In college I've mostly studied C# and C++. Most recently I found interest in web design therefore im
      trying to tone my skills in languages such as JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and also using jQuerry and Bootstrap!
